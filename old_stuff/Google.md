### Avalicao Constantino 3 

Avaliacao contstantino 

- 1.1.1. The Economic Imperative of Automation
- 1.1.2 From Static Analysis to Generative Reasoning
	RMEove these and make those runnign text 

---
1.3 , 1.4 , 1.5 
* Com titulo objective and hipothesis

Chapter 2 

2.1 Introduction  
	Change from introduction  to methododlogy and put together 2.1 and 2.2 

2.2.1 Research Questions - needs to be moved to top as 2.2 

2.2.2 Search Strategy 
	- neds to be moved to 2.3 



2.2.3 Inclusion and Exclusion Criteria 
	Needds to be movede ot 2.4 


2.2.4 Study Selection Process 

	- Needs to be moved to 2.5


2.2.5 Quality Assessment
	Needs tp be m,oved inside research startegy 

----

2.3.1 RQ1: Architecture & Orchestration
For each of these questions try and develop a bit more 



-----


2.4 Discussion - 

	THis is too short , needs to be exapanded , here we should discuss and tell my opinion what was found what is missing and what I think I will solve withing the gaps and problems I found

Move to anothe chapter apart  with name Ethical and Data privacy considerations
Add the data found from previous the preivous article PSGEIA into this one

---
2.6 Kepp as is , but can be merged into 2.4 + 2.6
